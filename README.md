# Credit Card Fraud Detection

## Introduction
Credit card fraud is a wide-ranging term for theft and fraud committed using or involving a payment card, such as a credit card or debit card, as a fraudulent source of funds in a transaction. The purpose may be to obtain goods or services, or to make payment to another account which is controlled by a criminal. The Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is the data security standard created to help businesses process card payments securely and reduce card fraud. The standard applies to all organizations which hold, process, or pass cardholder information from any card branded with the logo of one of the card brands.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to build a machine learning model to predict fraudulent credit card transactions using a dataset of real transactions. The dataset contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.

## Dataset
The dataset is available at the following link: [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)

## Approach
The approach to build the machine learning model is as follows:
1. Introduction
2. State of the Art
3. Dataset Analysis
4. Machine Learning Models
5. Tunning Hyperparameters
6. Model Evaluation
7. Conclusion

## Conclusion
The machine learning model was able to predict fraudulent credit card transactions with high accuracy. The model can be used by financial institutions to detect and prevent credit card fraud.
